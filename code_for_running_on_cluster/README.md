In order to run this array job on a cluster, upload the files in this folder *and* all modules in the folder [python_code](https://github.com/marieke-woensdregt/model_coevolution_language_mindreading/tree/master/python_code), and submit the job with the command `qsub eddie_run_learner_speaker_diff_lexicons_p_prior_egoc_sp_literal_P1_a1_lr_perspective-taking_a1_lr_sp_hyp_literal_300_C_200_R.sh`
Each individual simulation should take about 7 hours to run. So to do a quick test run make sure you decrease both the number of observations (e.g. change `n_contexts = 300` to `n_contexts = 30` and `n_runs = 200` to `n_runs = 2`) in the parameter settings block at the top of the script `run_learner_speaker_diff_lexicons_p_prior_egoc_sp_literal_P1_a1_lr_perspective-taking_a1_lr_sp_hyp_literal_300_C_200_R.py`.
You can then also change the maximum number of hours allowed for the simulation in the `.sh` file by changing the parameter `#$ -l h_rt=15:00:00` to e.g. `#$ -l h_rt=02:00:00`. That way your job will have to wait less long in your cluster's queue.

# model_coevolution_language_mindreading
In this repository you can find all the Python code I used to implement my Bayesian model of the co-evolution of language and mindreading (including development, iterated learning and biological evolution). I divided the code up into several modules which implement different parts of the model (e.g. agents, languages, contexts and so on). Then there are three modules which import all these modules in order to run a full simulation. The module 'run_learner_speaker.py' runs a simulation of a single learner learning from a single speaker; the module 'run_pop_iteration.py' runs a simulation of a whole population transmitting languages over generations using iterated learning; and finally, the module 'run_evolvability_analysis.py' runs a full simulation including both cultural tranmission of languages and genetic inheritance of literal/pragmatic communication abilities. I used a mixture of object-oriented programming and regular functions, and explained how each function, class or method works using docstrings. I also used long and intelligible variable and function names, which should hopefully make the code relatively easy to read.
